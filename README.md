# Bank

A C# program to help balance your Bank Account in the Prototype (initial balance = 0). In this Program we are taking inputs from user to help balance the bank account by using different methods.


Methods:

“GetAmount, Deposit, Withdrawal, Print.”


Variable Names:

“bonus (Defined as double floating point point and is taken constant by defining value of 0.01 i.e. 1% to it), Transaction (Variable to define transaction type and this is defined as a character), Bal (Defined as double to display total money/balance in the account), Amount (Defined as double to calculate changes happening in account and update the balance of account).”


NOTE:

“If the amount of the deposit is greater than or equal to $2000, the customer receives a 1% bonus on the amount of the deposit (e.g., if $2000 is deposited, then add $2020 to the account).”

“$1.50 service charge is applied to each withdrawal. The withdrawal (and service charge) is not applied if it will leave a negative balance and the customer should be warned (an error message should be printed).”
